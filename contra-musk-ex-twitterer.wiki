§§ Contra Musk

Elon Musk was once acclaimed by many aligned with U.S. left-wing politics as a //champion// due to his investment and entrepreneurial activities with electric cars and solar energy technology, and thought of by some as a real-life version of (the fictional Marvel character) Tony Stark (who some may better know as //Iron Man//).
This left-wing admiration of Elon Musk eventually transformed into a dislike.

This left-wing dislike of Elon Musk seems to stem from Musk being critical the U.S. Democratic Party and some instances of U.S. left-wing politics, as well as expressing that he would vote for Republican Party candidates due to his dissatisfaction with incumbent U.S. Democratic Party members.

And conformity seems to spread the reaction further.

§§ Wants

• A **Contra Musk Ex-Twitterer** wants to //not// be on a Elon Mush run Twitter

§§ Problems

• conflicts with people who have been part of the Fediverse before the Twitter-migration event over social norms — for example: //content-warnings//, //image-captions//, etc.
