§ Fediverse Archetypes

by [Charles Iliya Krempeaux](http://reiver.link/)

---

This document is a distillation of the **industrial-research** we did on the **Fediverse**.

This analysis is meant to be **descriptive**.
I.e., it is trying to list out what is there.
It is _not_ a statement of what should or shouldn't be there.
And neither is it an endorsement or a condemnation of anything that is there.
It is **description** of what seems to be observed.

⚠️ **This document tries to use _"neutral"_ language in its descriptions.** ⚠️

§§ Archetypes

> archetypes (noun): an idealized model of a number of similar things.

From the point-of-view of **industrial-research** — an **archetype** is a model of some aspect of a person shared among many people.

(UX people tend to call "**archetypes**": "**personas**".
And marketers tend to call "**archetypes**": "**segments**".
In practice, all 3 of these are very similar concepts.)

Some examples of (non-Fediverse specific) **archetypes** include:

* father,
* mother,
* son,
* daughter
* brother,
* sister,
* husband,
* wife,
* gardener,
* farmer,
* computer programmer,
* grocery store cashier,
* CEO
* CTO
* etc.

You can also probably already see that an individual could express more than one **archetype**.
For example — a single individual could be — a _father_, a _husband_, a _brother_, a _son_, a _CTO_, and a _programmer_ **at the same time** during a certain span of their life.

The **archetypes** an individual expresses could also change over their life-time too.
For example — before someone has a child, they wouldn't be a _father_ or a _mother_ yet; but after they have a child, they would (also) become a _father_, or a _mother_ (in addition to whatever other archetypes they express).

This document includes **archetypes** relevant to the Fediverse that the author(s) have deemed "important" for a particular purpose.

§§ Accessibility Advocate

An **Accessibility Advocate** is someone on the Fediverse who advocates for and who may even by fanatical about others adding _caption-text_ to images in posts.

They will often hound others on the Fediverse to edit posts to add _caption-text_ to images that do not have _caption-text_ (by replying to posts with images without _caption-text_).
They will also often talk about screen-readers.

§§§ Wants

* wants all images posted on the Fediverse to have _caption-text_

§§§ Problems

* many (maybe most) people who create posts with images on the Fediverse don't include _caption-text_ for the images

---

§§ Ambitious Admin

An **Ambitious Admin** is an administrator of one or more Fediverse community servers who is looking to turn their Fediverse community server(s) into a source of income for themselves, and maybe even a money making enterprise (beyond their personal needs).

Although there are threads of the Fediverse that is (what in the U.S. would tend to get labeled) far-leftist and is anti-making-money, an **Ambitious Admin** is not.
An **Ambitious Admin** may not feel comfortable sharing their _ambition_ with these _threads_ on the Fediverse, so as not to be the target of hate and hostility from them.

§§§ Wants

* wants to make money — to pay for the costs of the server, to pay their bills, to pay for a better life, or even to operate an enterprise

§§§ Problems

* accepting payments / credits via credit card (an possibly other means)

---

§§ Anxious Anna

An **Anxious Anna** is someone who doesn't like publicly posting content because they are afraid of other judging them as being **not smart enough** (i.e., looking **dumb**), or **not creative enough**, etc.

Some **Anxious Annas** will on rare occasians make public posts.
Sometimes due to real or imagined social-pressure they feel to post something.
But their posts will tend to be void of any context or information so as to not attract the (negative) judgement of others.

**Anxious Annas** tend to mostly send private messages to their close friends.
Sometimes on a one-of-one basis.
Sometimes in a group (of friends) basis.

**Anxious Annas** may consume other people's public content usually without commenting, favoriting, or (publicly) re-sharing.

§§§ Wants

* wants obscurity and to be inconspicuous
* wants social-interaction with their close friends

§§§ Problems

* worried that others might judge them as being **not smart enough** (i.e., looking **dumb**), or **not creative enough**, etc

§§ Columnist

A **Columnist** (also sometimes called a **jounalist** or a **reporter**) is someone who writes regularly for a newspaper or magazine.

**Columnists** tend to be under a lot of pressure to create articles for newspapers or magazines quickly.
**Columnists** tend to not have time to understand or (more than superficially) investigate the topics they are writing about.

**Columnists** often use social-media to find stuff to write about.
**Columnists** often follow certain people on social-media, and put certain people on social-media on lists, so that if one of those people posts something they think is interesting enough, they will covertly turn into an article to post to a newspaper or magazine (usually without giving credit to the person they copied).

Some **Columnists** are [Influceners](§influencer), but most are not.

§§§ Wants

* wants to follow others who create content that they can covertly turn into an article to post to a newspaper or magazine (usually without giving credit to the person they copied)

§§ Problems

* they are under a lot of pressure to create articles for newspapers or magazines quickly, which doesn't give them any time to understand or investigate the topic they are writing about
* articles they write usually have serious errors and factual inaccuracies

---

§§ Community Organizer

Sometimes communities form "organically" — but this seems to be very very rare.
It seems like when a community exists — usually a single person, through their initial and ongoing actions, will create the **community** and cause it to continue to exist.

We call this person a **Community Organizer**.

§§§ Wants

* social status
* some want others to share their passion with — which (that passion) may be the focus of the community
* some may be using the comminity as a way for them learning more about something — which (that "something") may be the focus of the community

§§ Contra Musk

A **Contra Musk** is reactionary who aligns with U.S. left-wing politics who left Twitter and joined the the Fediverse (usually on a Mastodon community server) because of their dislike of Elon Musk.

Elon Musk was once acclaimed by many aligned with U.S. left-wing politics as a _champion_ due to his investment and entrepreneurial activities with electric cars and solar energy technology, and thought of by some as a real-life version of (the fictional Marvel character) Tony Stark (who some may better know as _Iron Man_). This left-wing admiration of Elon Musk eventually transformed into a dislike.

This left-wing dislike of Elon Musk stems from Musk being critical the U.S. Democratic Party and some instances of U.S. left-wing politics, as well as expressing that he would vote for Republican Party candidates due to his dissatisfaction with incumbent U.S. Democratic Party members.

Most of the **Contra Musks** joined the Fediverse on or after November 2022.
This mass migration from Twitter to the Fediverse that started on November 2022 is known both as the **Twitter-migration** and the **eternal-November**.

§§§ Wants

* wants not to be on a Elon Mush run Twitter

§§§ Problems

* loosing some aspects of their pre-Elon Musk Twitter experience when they joined Mastodon
* resistance to making Mastodon or the Fediverse more like Twitter by people who have been part of the Fediverse before the Twitter-migration event

§§§ Problems

---

§§ Decentralization Advocate

A **Decentralization Advocate** (sometimes also called a "**Decentralist**") is someone on the Fediverse who advocates for and who may even by fanatical about _"decentralization"_ of (at least) social-media networks (and possibly other things too).
Either as a means to and end, or and an end in and of itself.

§§§ Wants

* wants decentralized social-media networks
* some even want others _not_ to use centralized social-media networks

§§§ Problems

---

§§ Entrepreneurial CEO

An **Entrepreneurial CEO** is someone willing to take risks and make sacrifices to start new **companies** that they lead and manage.

Some will work for months or years without getting paid, living off of their savings towards this goal.
And when they do finally get paid, they might pay themselves way below what they could make by being an employee for someone else's company — either due to a lack of funds, or so they can pay others.

**Entrepreneurial CEOs** should **not** be conflated with the type of person who tends be a **CEO** at large established companies.
These two types of **CEOs** seem to be different.
**Entrepreneurial CEOs** tend to be **CEOs** that create the company they are the **CEO** at — they are **not** the type of **CEO** that gets hired into the position.

**Entrepreneurial CEOs** tend to be open-minded and curious.

Due to their open-mindedness and curiousity **Entrepreneurial CEOs** are often one of the earlier adopters of technology.
Although **Entrepreneurial CEOs** usually adopt or try out new technology after **CTOs**.
And **CTOs** usually adopt or try out new technolgy either as part of or after **Computer Programmers**.

**Entrepreneurial CEOs** tend to be interested in one or more topics.

**Entrepreneurial CEOs** want to consume content on the topics they are interested in.
**Entrepreneurial CEOs** want to have discussions with other on the topics they are interested in — especially others who they believe are knowledgeable about the topics they are interested in.

Some people may call **Entrepreneurial CEOs**, [Entrepreneurial CTOs](§entrepreneurial-cto), and possibly others — **Founders** or **Startup Founders**.

Like with a lot of things from the early Internet — **finger** is **decentralized**.

**finger** is at the early stages of a revival.
With some people starting to use **finger** again.

Some **finger fans** are also on the Fediverse, due to being (somewhat) fellow-travelers with some on the Fediverse — namely the [Privacy Advocates](§privacy-advocate), the [Decentralization Advocates](§decentralization-advocate), the [Contra Advertisers](cContra-advertiser), and others.

Some have even hooked up **finger** to the Fediverse.

§§§ Wants

§§ Flocker

A **Flocker** is someone who joined the Fediverse as part of the **Twitter-migration** / **eternal-November** simply because they saw others joining, and Mastodon and the Fediverse were gaining "momentum".

With some people using **gopher** again.

The **gopher** revival seems to be a reaction to a feeling that the Internet, the Web, and the social-media is broken.

Some **gopher fans** are also on the Fediverse, due to being (somewhat) fellow-travelers with some on the Fediverse — namely the [Privacy Advocates](§privacy-advocate), the [Decentralization Advocates](§decentralization-advocate), [Contra Advertisers](§contra-advertiser), and others.

§§ Tech Columnist

A **Tech Columnist** (also sometimes called a **Tech jounalist** or a **Tech reporter**) is someone who write regularly about Tech for a newspaper or magazine.

There seems to be at least 3 reasons a **Tech Columnist** will join a new social-media platform early on:

* the **Tech Columnist** intends to regularly write about the new social-media platform;
* the **Tech Columnist** followed [Entrepreneurial CEOs](§entrepreneurial-ceo) onto the new social-media platform because they want to follow the [Entrepreneurial CEOs](§entrepreneurial-ceo)' posts to see if they post anything interesting that the **Tech Columnist** could covertly turn into an article to post to a newspaper or magazine;
* the **Tech Columnist** (like most [Columnists](§columnist)) came onto the new social-media platform because there are certain people on the social-media network that they want to follow so that if one of those people posts something they think is interesting enough, they will covertly turn into an article to post to a newspaper or magazine (usually without giving credit to the person they copied).

**Tech Columnists** (like most [Columnists](§columnist)) tend to be under a lot of pressure to create articles for newspapers or magazines quickly.

§§ Topic Backer

§§§ Problems

A **Video Vegetable** is someone who wants to be enthralled by watching video that they can veg-out too, and _not_ have to "think".

Commenting to video to too much "thinking" for a **Video Vegetable**.
