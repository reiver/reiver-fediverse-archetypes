§ Lazy Watcher

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

A **lazy watcher** is someone who wants to be enthralled by watching video that they can veg-out too, and //not// have to "think".

This could be one long video.
Or more likely nowadays, a series of short videos played contiguously one after another without interruption.

Commenting to video to too much "thinking" for a **Video Vegetable**.

§§ Wants

* wants to veg-out watching video(s).
